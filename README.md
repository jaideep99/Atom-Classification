# Atom-Classification

__Description:__

A new criterion of classification of atoms present in a bulk metallic glassy alloy has been
proposed and demonstrated in this work. The criterion is based on the comparison of the
atomic radii of the elements present in a given bulk metallic glassy alloy. Hence eliminates
the ambiguity in classification of the elements based on the atomic size, unlike Inoueâ€™s
atomic size criterion where the classification was based on the absolute atomic radii,
irrespective of the presence of the element in the given alloy. Further a computational
algorithm was also developed which confirms the atom as big/ small.
